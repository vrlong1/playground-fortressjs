# Configuration

Each part of FortressJS could be configured :
* Engines
* Apps / plugins
* Servers
* Hosts

You can easily enable or disable a component by switching its state to `true` or `false`.

Let's do that :

@[Change the state of the engine and the server]({"project":"configuration", "stubs": ["start-engine/engine/engine.conf.js", "start-server/start-server.conf.js"], "command": "./configuration.sh"})

By clicking on "Run", a script will execute the same step as the previous chapter.
