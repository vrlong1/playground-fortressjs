# Templates

You can manage your templates with pages as you want. For example, you can introduce your own custom variables like `__MY_VAR` and manage them in your page controller.

For example, find a way to get this work :

@[Get the page redirected]({"project":"redirect", "stubs": ["start-server/host/start/zone/front/page/home/home.page.js", "start-server/host/start/zone/front/page/home/view/redirect.html"], "command": "./redirect.sh"})
